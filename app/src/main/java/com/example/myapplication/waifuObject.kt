                "The elder brother, Ayato, is the head of the clan and is in charge of government affairs. While his younger sister, Ayaka, known by all as the Princess, takes care of the clan's internal and external affairs.\n" +
                "Ayaka often appears at social occasions and has more interactions with the common folk. As such, she is better known by the people and has gained a higher reputation than her elder brother. This has earned her the elegant title of Shirasagi Himegimi.\n" +
                "As is known to all, Ayaka, the daughter of the Kamisato family, is a figure greatly admired by the people for her beauty, dignified demeanor, and noble character.",
        "Beidou is the leader of The Crux — an armed crew based in Liyue Harbor.\n" +
                "An armed crew means exactly what it sounds like: a crew of sailors armed to the teeth.\n" +
                "Without getting into too many details, everything The Crux does is approved by the Qixing... more or less.\n" +
                "Beidou is a trusted leader, so much so that her crew believe her capable of taming the storms and billows on the sea.\n" +
                "\"It's Beidou! Even the mightiest of storms must bow its head to her might!\"",
        "Eula's role within the Knights of Favonius is Captain of the Reconnaisance Company.\n" +
                "The nature of her work means that she rarely sets foot in the city — she spends most of her time out in the wild, leading her team of scouts as they hunt down Abyss Order operatives and other monsters.",
        "Fischl is the Prinzessin der Verurteilung who arrived here after being exiled from the otherworld, \"Immernachtreich.\"\n" +
                "She \"observes and weaves the threads of fate\" together with her talking night raven familiar, Oz.",
        "Though many in Liyue are fascinated by life in Yujing Terrace, its day-to-day operations and rules are a mystery to them.\n" +
                "They are aware that the Liyue Qixing are the cream of the crop who hold the fate of the city in their hands, but the calculations and data behind the Qixing's every decision are far harder to grasp.",
        "The 77th Director of the Wangsheng Funeral Parlor, a young lady managing the parlor's operations. Despite her position, she's an amiable person who puts on no airs.\n" +
                "Her antics are as plentiful as the sand on Yaoguang Shoal. She never ceases to shock people with her countless bizarre ideas.",
        "Rex Lapis has brought prosperity and plenty to Liyue Harbor, and his rule and majesty have long passed into show and song, much to the delight of the people. But for someone in such proximity to a god, Keqing seems to lack the requisite respect the most.",

        "Teyvat is a place where people of all sorts go about their business. Merchants move products, knights patrol, and farmers till the land.\n" +
                "But if one were to ask Mona — the enigmatic and prideful astrologist — what she busies herself with, she will reply by saying that she is servicing a debt known as \"life.\"",
        "Greater Lord Rukkhadevata created Sumeru's rainforest and bestowed wisdom upon the people of Sumeru through the Akademiya. Despite her departure long ago, her name is still praised in the stories told in every household in Sumeru.\n" +
                "On the other hand, Lesser Lord Kusanali, who was whisked back by the sages to the Sanctuary of Surasthana following the former's fall, has been more of a symbol — one that signifies that the protection of divinity never ceased to exist on this land.",
        "Since the dawn of life, humankind has always borne an intense yearning for and curiosity about the world. This is the anchor point of their cognition and is the foundation of all reason.\n" +
                "The world of the people of Inazuma is also thus. There, thunder, lightning, wind, and rain were primordial facts of life, as well as light, and the sea... and the Raiden Shogun.",
        "\"Coming, coming! Here's your Stir-Fried Filet! And your Mora Meat. And Fried Radish Balls, as you ordered.\"\n" +

                "Come to think of it, Yae Miko's nicknames are as myriad as her changeable moods.",
        "Liyue's Ministry of Civil Affairs is an organization marked by transparency — from ordinary staff members of the Eight Trades to prominent officials of Yujing Terrace, every employee has their basic information documented in the Ministry's lists.\n" +
                "Yelan, despite claiming to work for the Ministry, is the sole exception. Most of her colleagues have never heard of her, nor is her name anywhere to be found on any rosters.",
        "Yoimiya's name is renowned throughout Hanamizaka.\n" +
